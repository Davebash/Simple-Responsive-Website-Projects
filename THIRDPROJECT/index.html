                <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is 
                    designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, 
                    run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
                </p>

                <p>Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java
                    Virtual Machine (JVM), regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of
                    Java is similar to C and C++, but Java has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
                </p>

                    <h2>Java Features</h2>
                    <li>Object-Oriented: Java supports the principles of object-oriented programming 
                        such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.</li>
                    <li>Platform-Independent: Programs written in Java are compiled into bytecode,
                         which can be run on any machine with a JVM</li>
                    <li>Automatic Memory Management: Java features automatic memory 
                        management and garbage collection, meaning developers do not need to 
                        manually manage memory allocation and deallocation.</li>

                <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW)</li>
                    <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                    <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about Java.</li>

                <header>Java vs. C++</header>
                <p>Java and C++ have some significant differences:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Memory Management: Java uses an automatic garbage collector to manage
                         memory, whereas C++ requires manual memory allocation and deallocation 
                         (using new, delete).
                    </li>
                    <li>Platform Independence: Java is platform-independent due to the JVM. C++
                         code needs to be compiled separately for each platform.
                    </li>
                    <li>Syntax and Complexity: Java is generally simpler with fewer low-level 
                        constructs like pointers, while C++ provides more fine-grained control over
                         system resources.</li>
                    <li>Use Cases: Java is widely used in web applications, mobile development 
                        (Android), and enterprise software. C++ is used for game development, high-
                        performance computing, and systems programming.

                <header> Object-Oriented Programming in Java</header>
                <p>Java is a pure object-oriented language, where almost everything (except primitive 
                    types) is an object. Key OOP principles in Java include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Encapsulation: Restricting direct access to an object's data and providing
                         methods for interaction.
                    </li>
                    <li>Inheritance: The ability for classes to inherit properties and methods from 
                        other classes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Polymorphism: Allowing one interface to be used for different data types.
                         Here's an example of a simple class in Java:
                    </li>
                    <code>
                        class Car {
                            String brand;
                            int speed;
                        
                            void accelerate() {
                                speed += 10;
                            }
                        }          
                    </code>
                    <p>The Car class encapsulates properties (brand, speed) and behavior (accelerate).</p>
                </ul>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section id="hello">
            <article>
                <header>Hello World</header>
                <p>Here is a simple "Hello, World!" example in Java:</p>
                <code>
                    public class Main {
                        public static void main(String[] args) {
                            System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
                        }
                    }                    
                </code>
                <p>This code defines a Java class named Main with a main method, which serves as
                   the entry point for any standalone Java application. The method prints "Hello, World!"
                   to the console.
                </p>

            <article>
                <header>Variables</header>
                <p>In both Java and C++, variables act as containers to store data values. However,
                     Java variables fall into primitive and reference types. Primitive types include int,
                     boolean, char, etc., while reference types store addresses of objects. In C++,
                     variables are typically primitive, but pointers and references add complexity,
                     allowing direct memory access. Java simplifies this by removing the need for pointers.</p>

        <section id="declaring">
            <article>
                <header>Declaring Variables</header>
                <p>In Java, variables must be declared with a type:</p>
                <code>
                    int myNumber = 5;
                    String name = "John";                      
                </code>
                <p>C++ follows a similar structure but allows for more complexity, such as pointers:</p>
                <code>
                    int* ptr;  // Pointer declaration in C++ 
                </code>
                <p>Java's approach ensures more safety by abstracting memory management, while
                   C++ offers more flexibility and control.

                <header>Variable Scope</header>
                <p>Variable scope defines where in a program a variable can be accessed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Local Scope: Variables declared inside a method (Java) or function (C++) are
                         accessible only within that method or function.
                    </li>
                    <li>Class Scope: Variables declared at the class level are accessible throughout the class.
                         Java variables declared within a block {} have scope limited to that
                         block, whereas C++ allows more control with pointers and references.
                    </li>

                <p>Global variables are variables accessible from any part of the program:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Java: Global variables are often simulated using static class members, as Java
                         doesn't support true global variables.
                    </li>   
                    <code>
                      class MyClass {
                          static int globalVar = 100;
                      }                     
                    </code>
                    <li>C++: Global variables can be declared outside of all functions and classes,
                         making them accessible everywhere in the program.

                <header>Constants</header>
                <p>Constants are fixed values that cannot change during program execution. In Java,
                     you define constants using the final keyword:
                </p>
                <code>
                    final int MAX_SPEED = 120;  
                </code>
                <p>
                    In C++, constants are declared using const: 
                </p>
                <code>
                    const int MAX_SPEED = 120;
                </code>
                <p>
                    Java constants are typically declared within a class, whereas C++ constants can be
                     declared globally or locally.

            <article>
                <p>Java and C++ both support basic data types like int, float, and char. Java also
                    provides wrapper classes (Integer, Float) to convert primitive data into objects.
                    C++ supports more low-level data management through pointers, structures, and unions, allowing you to manipulate memory directly. Both languages 
                    enforce strict typing, but C++ allows more flexibility through templates and type casting.

                <header>if...else statement</header>
                <p>The if...else statement controls conditional execution in both Java and C++. 
                   Their syntax is very similar:
                </p>
                <code>
                    if (condition) {
                        // code
                    } else {

                    }                                        
                </code>
                <p>The statement checks the condition: if true, the first block of code executes;
                   otherwise, the code in the else block runs. In both languages, these statements
                   are used to make decisions and control program flow.

                <header>while statement</header>
                <p>Both Java and C++ use the while loop for repeating code as long as a condition is true:</p>
                <code>
                    while (condition) {
                        // loop body
                    }                    
                </code>
                <p>This loop checks the condition before each iteration. If the condition is false at the
                   start, the loop will not execute at all. It's commonly used for continuous checks
                   or processing data streams.

                <header>Function declarations</header>
                <p>Functions (or methods in Java) are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Java: Functions are always defined within classes and are known as methods. For example:</li>
                    <code>
                        public void myFunction() {
                            // code

                    </code>
                    <li>C++: Functions can exist globally or inside classes. For example:</li>
                    <code>
                        void myFunction() {

                    <p>Java's methods must belong to classes, while C++ supports both free functions and
                     methods within classes, giving it more flexibility.
